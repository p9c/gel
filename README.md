Gio elements

This is a widget toolkit based on the basic set of material widgets built with Gio.

So far, the following additional widgets have been created - scrollbar for the scrolling list, a column and basic table, and a top-bar side-bar status-bar multi-page application, and a background process runner to minimise interruptions to the rendering of the interfaces.

Gel uses fluent programming techniques to simplify and denoise the visual structure of Gio widget definitions.

Future plans include creating a serialization format for events and render trees and accompanying socket transports to enable remote display and control of user interfaces.
